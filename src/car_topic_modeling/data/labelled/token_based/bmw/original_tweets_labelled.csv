1.8831081461739397e+18,"Dear @BMW, After 15 years of loyalty to your brand, I never expected to feel this level of disappointment. The turbo oil feed line (#11425A76559) has become a source of frustration for many owners. Why does a so-called 'premium' car require an engine removal to replace what should be a straightforward and routine part? This issue is not unique to me. Many loyal customers are facing the same costly and avoidable repair. A luxury car should offer exceptional engineering, not burdensome maintenance costs that stem from questionable design choices. As a long-time BMW customer who has stood by your brand, I feel let down. Is this the standard of engineering we‚Äôre expected to accept? Are premium prices now just for the badge, not the quality? I ask you very clearly: Is the turbo oil feed line a poorly placed wear part, or is it a standard part of low quality that breaks far too quickly? Your customers deserve transparency, accountability, and a solution to this issue. I look forward to your response. #BMW #BMWQuality #GermanEngineering #TurboOilLineLeak #CustomerLoyalty #BMWOwners",Sat Jan 25 11:02:23 +0000 2025,3335671377.0,EzadaSinn,1.8831081461739397e+18,en,False,,,https://x.com/EzadaSinn/status/1883108146173939744,10,0,7,35,dear years loyalty brand expected feel level disappointment turbo oil feed line a source frustration owners socalled premium car require engine removal replace straightforward routine issue unique loyal customers facing costly avoidable repair luxury car offer exceptional engineering burdensome maintenance costs stem questionable design choices longtime bmw customer stood brand feel let standard engineering expected accept premium prices badge quality ask clearly turbo oil feed line poorly placed wear standard low quality breaks far quickly customers deserve transparency accountability solution issue look forward response bmw bmwquality germanengineering turbooillineleak customerloyalty bmwowners,
