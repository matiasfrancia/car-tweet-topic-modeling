I was told it would take 1.5 hours.  I did not receive a report on my vehicle's inspection until 11:16 a.m. But that didn't mean the work was done. Nope, they were simply telling me they inspected the vehicle and only then asked me what services I wanted.  It is now 1:10 P.M. - that's almost 5 hours - and am being told it ""just takes time"" as my vehicle is STILL NOT DONE. Manager told me he's charging me full price, but I can ""speak to the service manager tomorrow and see what he says""; in short, I should come back and speak with him myself. I own and manage my own business. I am in my office from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and bring my vehicle in for service on weekends because those are the only days I am available to address issues like this, but to address the clear lack of competence, leadership and accountability I am told I should come back and address it at a time convenient for the supervising manager. Last time I was here they forgot my vehicle was done and left in the parking lot for 45 minutes while I was waiting for them to pull it around. I was apologized to then, but clearly nothing has been learned.  And I still cannot work while waiting here since their WiFi blocks VPN connections; I cannot work without a VPN due to client-confidentiality.  @AutoNation does not give a rat's backside about it's customers - even after that customer has spent nearly $100,000 on vehicles in the last 2 years at that dealership.

1.8111165511787072e+18,"@KoonsOfTysons, @Toyota , @ToyotaMotorCorp I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a recent experience I had with my brand new Toyota BZ4x 2024, an electric vehicle that has only 821 miles on it. Initially, I was very pleased with my purchase. However, after returning from a week-long vacation, I discovered that my car was completely dead. This was quite surprising and concerning, given that it is a brand new vehicle with a brand new battery. When I called Toyota Roadside Assistance, I was kept waiting for two and a half hours, only to find out later that my call had been canceled without any notification. I only learned of this cancellation after calling to inquire about the status. Fortunately, I was at home and not stranded on the road. On the second attempt, help finally arrived this morning, and my car was jump-started. I then took it to the dealership for further inspection. After spending the entire morning at the dealership, I was informed that the vehicle was functioning properly and that the battery had died because it had not been driven for a week. I was told that this is normal for these new cars. This explanation is both unacceptable and troubling. It is difficult to believe that a brand new car with a brand new battery would completely deplete after just one week of not being driven. If this is indeed the case, it raises serious concerns about the quality and reliability of these vehicles. I never expected to encounter such issues with a Toyota, nor did I anticipate the dealership’s response that this is simply how these cars operate. I hope you understand my frustration and disappointment. I trust that Toyota will address these concerns and provide a satisfactory resolution. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.",Wed Jul 10 19:13:29 +0000 2024,17711305.0,cuchovivas,1.8111165511787072e+18,en,False,KoonsOfTysons,,https://x.com/cuchovivas/status/1811116551178707143,0,0,1,0.0,writing express dissatisfaction recent experience brand new toyota bzx electric vehicle miles initially pleased purchase returning weeklong vacation discovered car completely dead surprising concerning given brand new vehicle brand new battery called toyota roadside assistance kept waiting half hours find later canceled notification learned cancellation calling inquire status fortunately home stranded road second attempt help finally arrived morning car jumpstarted took dealership inspection spending entire morning dealership informed vehicle functioning properly battery died driven week told normal new cars explanation unacceptable troubling difficult believe brand new car brand new battery completely deplete week driven case raises concerns quality reliability vehicles expected encounter issues toyota anticipate dealership response simply cars operate hope understand frustration disappointment trust toyota address concerns provide satisfactory resolution thank attention matter look forward prompt response,

1.71739015881368e+18,"@Toyota @ToyotaMotorCorp #ToyotaWarAgainstHandicappedPeople I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and concern with Toyota's recent actions, which have left me and my family feeling disappointed and discriminated against. This ordeal centers around a brand new Toyota Camry that my uncle purchased in 2013, and a subsequent motor failure that led to Toyota's offer of a $2,000 voucher for a new car. Regrettably, Toyota's refusal to honor this voucher when purchasing a new, accessible Sienna for my handicapped daughter has left us deeply disheartened. My uncle's Toyota Camry served us well for ten years, accumulating only 120,000 miles, which is considerably less than one would typically expect from a Toyota vehicle. We understand that automobiles wear down over time, but a motor failure of this magnitude after just a decade is quite unusual, especially considering Toyota's reputation for quality and longevity. When we approached Toyota, they offered us a $2,000 voucher as compensation, seemingly to ease the burden of having to purchase a new vehicle. As a family with a handicapped daughter, our needs extend beyond the ordinary. It became necessary to purchase a wheelchair-accessible van to accommodate her requirements. We turned to A&J Mobility, a reputable handicap vehicle dealer, known for converting Toyota Sienna vans to make them accessible for individuals like my daughter. We expected to apply the $2,000 voucher towards the purchase of a new, accessible Sienna as it would have been the most practical choice for us. However, our disappointment knows no bounds when Toyota refused to honor the voucher for the purchase of the accessible Sienna. This decision by Toyota has not only left us feeling discriminated against due to our family's unique needs. The refusal to extend the voucher to a more suitable vehicle for our handicapped daughter is not only unprofessional but also deeply inhumane. We understand that corporate policies and terms may exist, but in this situation, where we have been loyal customers of Toyota and are faced with an extraordinary need, we had expected more compassion and understanding from a company of Toyota's stature. This ordeal has left us questioning Toyota's commitment to its customers and, more importantly, its consideration for individuals with special needs. In light of this situation, I kindly request that Toyota reviews its decision to deny the voucher's application towards the accessible Sienna we purchased through A&J Mobility. It is my hope that Toyota will reconsider this decision and make the necessary amendments to better reflect the values of fairness and compassion that we expect from a renowned company such as Toyota. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter. Please understand that this experience has had a significant impact on our family, and we hope for a positive resolution that will restore our faith in Toyota as a responsible and customer-centric corporation.",Thu Oct 26 03:58:16 +0000 2023,405271275.0,EbrramTadros,1.71739015881368e+18,en,False,Toyota,,https://x.com/EbrramTadros/status/1717390158813679944,5,0,33,3.0,toyotawaragainsthandicappedpeople writing express deep dissatisfaction concern toyotas recent actions left family feeling disappointed discriminated ordeal centers brand new toyota camry uncle purchased subsequent motor failure led toyotas offer voucher new car regrettably toyotas refusal honor voucher purchasing new accessible sienna handicapped daughter left deeply disheartened uncles toyota camry served years accumulating miles considerably typically expect toyota vehicle understand automobiles wear time motor failure magnitude decade unusual especially considering toyotas reputation quality longevity approached toyota offered voucher compensation seemingly ease burden having purchase new vehicle family handicapped daughter needs extend ordinary necessary purchase wheelchairaccessible van accommodate requirements turned aj mobility reputable handicap vehicle dealer known converting toyota sienna vans accessible individuals like daughter expected apply voucher purchase new accessible sienna practical choice disappointment knows bounds toyota refused honor voucher purchase accessible sienna decision toyota left feeling discriminated familys unique needs refusal extend voucher suitable vehicle handicapped daughter unprofessional deeply inhumane understand corporate policies terms exist situation loyal customers toyota faced extraordinary need expected compassion understanding company toyotas stature ordeal left questioning toyotas commitment customers importantly consideration individuals special needs light situation kindly request toyota reviews decision deny vouchers application accessible sienna purchased aj mobility hope toyota reconsider decision necessary amendments better reflect values fairness compassion expect renowned company toyota look forward prompt response resolution matter understand experience significant impact family hope positive resolution restore faith toyota responsible customercentric corporation,
