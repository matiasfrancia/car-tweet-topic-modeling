1.813758840548258e+18,"Question üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è a topic that is not typical for me haha! I know significantly less about cars than child safety, and would appreciate anyone‚Äôs helpful thoughts. We bought a car 14 months ago. It had about 12000kms on it, was from a very reputable dealership and a very highly regarded manufacturer (or so we thought) with a new car manufacturers warranty on it. It wasn‚Äôt a cheap car, it was needed to meet the needs of a family with pets and kids etc - it is one of two 7 seaters with the ability to tow a caravan, that I can drive with my spinal injury. It was an investment in lifestyle and something we chose to spend a bit on knowing it would lead to lots of adventures together. It broke down 3 times in the first 5 weeks, with the third time resulting in it being towed (again) to the dealership and they have had it FOR OVER 12 MONTHS.  During this time; we have been told a litany of lies, inconsistencies and been bullied extensively. We waited for our car to be repaired, under immense pressure from the dealer principal who consistently told us there were no parts available in the world (seriously) to fix it.  We were told we had to accept a refund (and sign an NDA) that the manufacturer would cover to the best of our knowledge, around the same time as learning that the same guy had ordered the genuine parts to repair our car, presumably to sell it a second time whilst the manufacturer paid us a refund. A year later, a refund doesn‚Äôt come close to covering our costs let alone to covering the cost of replacing the car with one similar.  The dealer principal allegedly has a history of misconduct, bullying and skimming staffs commission - he was marched out of the same dealership a few years back, only to inexplicably be put back in that same role, where he has continued to put consumers and I‚Äôm guessing staff, at risk. The company that did this, owns hundreds of dealerships Australia wide.  9 or so days after that last absurd claim that not a part in the world was available (it‚Äôs a DPF issue, in a fairly new car), after we reluctantly escalated it to the Head Office, we were told it was miraculously repaired and ready. We were over the moon. But. We got it, and despite being told it was undrivable and unrepairable for a year (by the dealership - the manufacturer was actually helpful) it has an additional 6000kms on the odometer üò¨üòî They are refusing to explain this. It has broken down AGAIN; on the weekend and has been towed again. We had it back for 9 days. Bringing the total time it has been in our possession to five weeks out of 14 months of ownership.  We don‚Äôt have a car I can drive now, with small kids who need to go to school, a bush property that is in a fire zone with no way to evacuate and quite frankly - I‚Äôm so over powerful bullies trampling ppl.  We bought this vehicle as something nice for our family on the back of the Commission of Inquiry stress, to go on road trips in and have time together recovering from the previous 4 years of work in Tasmania. What are our rights here? The Australian consumer law seems quite straight forwards re conduct and obligations. But they seem to be unwilling to adhere to it. We are concerned for all other consumers too. üò£ This is the largest automotive group in the country.  Why would we accept a refund if it would mean we lose our car, the extended warranty the manufacturer gave us and the ability to purchase another because they have gone up in price so much? Especially after being victims to so much deceptive and misleading conduct. The dealer principal was shuffled to another ‚Äòreputable‚Äô dealership last week. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (GODDAMNIT NOT MORE OF THE SHUFFLING‚Ä¶) Just want my car to be honest.

1.8962105038628088e+18,"So you buy a family car, it breaks down two weeks later, spends 22 months getting further broken in the service centre, and ultimately repaired when a different mechanic took over - and you go to inspect it, and its got over 8000kms added to the odometer, has been in an accident, has tech reports that have been sanitised and the unsanitised ones you finally get show your car was broken and damaged more, in the Dealerships custody! They REFUSE to answer questions about any of this unless a judge orders them to (costs about 200k to get that...), They literally said 'We have the money'.  What does one do? üò≠ 8000kms??? whilst our car was 'undrivable'? I can't even. We have had our car for 4 weeks of two years and nearly died when we went to see it recently.

We have no car, and they're blatantly abusing power. Its vile, and we would really like it to stop. Never buy from them - they will threaten and intimidate you because they can..  Do we report the damage to police? I guess we have to? It is still in their custody because we can't accept it back as it is... But they crashed my car? and drove it what - Across the Country?!?

I respect you for what you do and have been a loyal merc customer for last 8 years, I am an expat in Czech and my husband is French as I work for one of the most respectable firms in Czech named Asahi and decided to upgrade my car - sell my class A back to you and buy a new either CLA 45, GLC or GLE‚Ä¶ we explored which is fair and reached out to two showrooms 1. At Labem and 2. At Chodov, two of the most arrogant sales reps I have met in my life. We were introduced to David Andel as he is the most arrogant person we know. To show us different cars he immediately in a week decided we weren‚Äôt serious. We ignored and started the process and he asked for papers to draft the contract and while we provided him resident card, blue card he told us to provide rodne cislo(birth number) - I am an expat unaware of process and fairly new to Czech found different documents with different numbers - as I inquired I kept him posted while he decided to immediately be judge mental and decline to sell the car‚Ä¶ he also had a document from my company which I assure you is salary for at least 2-3 people put together on that level can be more. It doesn't end there I offered for him to talk to my expat team who managed all the papers for my relocations and he refused to do so thinking I am faking my identity - feels like Czech is distributing fake resident cards and blue cards. I am sure he wouldn‚Äôt do that if was someone from Europe and not an Indian(rascist behavior) - He started suspecting my identity and ignoring the fact with his know it all attitude that non EU CITIZEN and EU citizens birth numbers work differently. I am happy to share conversation screenshots and all the details. We realize it took us some time to find the birth number card but do other things don‚Äôt matter? Do you guys really have the right to treat us like nomads or fake people? He has caused me mental trauma today. He can question my papers and identity but least he can do is be educated on policies and be sure his knowledge is accurate.

1.854910281815659e+18,"@MercedesBenzUK @MercedesBenz I am following up on a complaint I raised in August 2024, as I have yet to receive an update. ¬† In September 2021, I purchased a one-year-old GLE 2020 from a Mercedes-Benz dealership. Upon delivery, the car had condensation in the headlights and rear light, bubbling and drip marks in the paintwork, and loose components. These defects were reported immediately, and the car was returned for repairs, which took three months. However, issues persisted, particularly with the headlight system, which has required multiple repairs at my local dealership. ¬† In July 2024, the headlight system malfunctioned again. After a ¬£600 diagnosis, I was informed that water ingress caused the failure, and repairs would cost around ¬£4,000. This car has never been in an accident, and all repairs have been done through Mercedes. I was told my extended warranty would not cover the water damage, which is concerning given the car‚Äôs low mileage (under 30,000 miles). ¬†This leads me to believe that the initial repairs were not carried out to a satisfactory standard or could this be a manufacturing issue? ¬† Despite contacting your complaints team in August 2024, I have received no follow-up.
